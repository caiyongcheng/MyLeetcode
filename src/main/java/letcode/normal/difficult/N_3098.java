 * You are given an integer array nums of length n, and a positive integer k.
 * The power of a  subsequence  is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence.
 * Return the sum of powers of all subsequences of nums which have length equal to k.
 * Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
