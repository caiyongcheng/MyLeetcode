/**
 * You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.
 * In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order.
 * Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly.
 * The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].
 * Since the brewing process is delicate,
 * a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work.
 * This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives.
 * Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.
