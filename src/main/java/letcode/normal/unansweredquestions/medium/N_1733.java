/**
 * On a social network consisting of m users and some friendships between users, 
 * two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language. 
 * You are given an integer n, an array languages,
 * and an array friendships where:
 * There are n languages numbered 1 through n,
 * languages[i] is the set of languages the ith user knows,
 * and friendships[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a friendship between the users ui and vi.
 * You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other.
 * Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.
 * Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if x is a friend of y and y is a friend of z,
 * this doesn't guarantee that x is a friend of z.
