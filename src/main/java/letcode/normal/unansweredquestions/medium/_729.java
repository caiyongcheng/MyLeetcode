/**
 * You are implementing a program to use as your calendar.
 * We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.
 * A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).
 * The event can be represented as a pair of integers startTime and endTime that represents a booking on
 * the half-open interval [startTime, endTime), the range of real numbers x such that startTime <= x < endTime.
 * Implement the MyCalendar class:  MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object. boolean book(int startTime, int endTime)
 * Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise,
 * return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
