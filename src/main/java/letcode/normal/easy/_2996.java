/**
 * 2996. Smallest Missing Integer Greater Than Sequential Prefix Sum
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/smallest-missing-integer-greater-than-sequential-prefix-sum/
 * <p>
 * You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums .
 * <p>
 * A prefix nums[0..i] is sequential if, for all 1 <= j <= i , nums[j] = nums[j - 1] + 1 . In
 * particular, the prefix consisting only of nums[0] is sequential .
 * <p>
 * Return the smallest integer x missing from nums such that x is greater than or equal to the sum of
 * the longest sequential prefix.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,5]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The longest sequential prefix of nums is [1,2,3] with a sum of 6. 6 is not in the
 * array, therefore 6 is the smallest missing integer greater than or equal to the sum of the longest
 * sequential prefix.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,12,14,13]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: The longest sequential prefix of nums is [3,4,5] with a sum of 12. 12, 13, and 14
 * belong to the array while 15 does not. Therefore 15 is the smallest missing integer greater than or
 * equal to the sum of the longest sequential prefix.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * - 1 <= nums.length <= 50
 * <p>
 * - 1 <= nums[i] <= 50
