/**
 * 3756. Concatenate Non-Zero Digits and Multiply by Sum II
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/concatenate-non-zero-digits-and-multiply-by-sum-ii/
 *
 * You are given a string s of length m consisting of digits. You are also given a 2D integer array
 * queries , where queries[i] = [l i , r i ] .
 *
 * For each queries[i] , extract the substring s[l i ..r i ] . Then, perform the following:
 *
 * - Form a new integer x by concatenating all the non-zero digits from the substring in their original
 * order. If there are no non-zero digits, x = 0 .
 *
 * - Let sum be the sum of digits in x . The answer is x * sum .
 *
 * Return an array of integers answer where answer[i] is the answer to the i th query.
 *
 * Since the answers may be very large, return them modulo 10 9 + 7 .
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "10203004", queries = [[0,7],[1,3],[4,6]]
 *
 * Output: [12340, 4, 9]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * - s[0..7] = "10203004"
 *
 * - x = 1234
 *
 * - sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
 *
 * - Therefore, answer is 1234 * 10 = 12340 .
 *
 * - s[1..3] = "020"
 *
 * - x = 2
 *
 * - sum = 2
 *
 * - Therefore, the answer is 2 * 2 = 4 .
 *
 * - s[4..6] = "300"
 *
 * - x = 3
 *
 * - sum = 3
 *
 * - Therefore, the answer is 3 * 3 = 9 .
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "1000", queries = [[0,3],[1,1]]
 *
 * Output: [1, 0]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * - s[0..3] = "1000"
 *
 * - x = 1
 *
 * - sum = 1
 *
 * - Therefore, the answer is 1 * 1 = 1 .
 *
 * - s[1..1] = "0"
 *
 * - x = 0
 *
 * - sum = 0
 *
 * - Therefore, the answer is 0 * 0 = 0 .
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "9876543210", queries = [[0,9]]
 *
 * Output: [444444137]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * - s[0..9] = "9876543210"
 *
 * - x = 987654321
 *
 * - sum = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 45
 *
 * - Therefore, the answer is 987654321 * 45 = 44444444445 .
 *
 * - We return 44444444445 modulo (10 9 + 7) = 444444137 .
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * - 1 <= m == s.length <= 10 5
 *
 * - s consists of digits only.
 *
 * - 1 <= queries.length <= 10 5
 *
 * - queries[i] = [l i , r i ]
 *
 * - 0 <= l i <= r i < m
