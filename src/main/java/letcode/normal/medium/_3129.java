/**
 * You are given 3 positive integers zero, one, and limit.  A  binary array  arr is called stable if:
 * The number of occurrences of 0 in arr is exactly zero. The number of occurrences of 1 in arr is exactly one.
 * Each  subarray  of arr with a size greater than limit must contain both 0 and 1. Return the total number
 * of stable binary arrays.  Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
