/**
 * 3532. Path Existence Queries in a Graph I
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Link: https://leetcode.cn/problems/path-existence-queries-in-a-graph-i/
 *
 * You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to n - 1 .
 *
 * You are also given an integer array nums of length n sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer
 * maxDiff .
 *
 * An undirected edge exists between nodes i and j if the absolute difference between nums[i] and
 * nums[j] is at most maxDiff (i.e., |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff ).
 *
 * You are also given a 2D integer array queries . For each queries[i] = [u i , v i ] , determine
 * whether there exists a path between nodes u i and v i .
 *
 * Return a boolean array answer , where answer[i] is true if there exists a path between u i and v i
 * in the i th query and false otherwise.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 2, nums = [1,3], maxDiff = 1, queries = [[0,0],[0,1]]
 *
 * Output: [true,false]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * - Query [0,0] : Node 0 has a trivial path to itself.
 *
 * - Query [0,1] : There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 1 because |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |1 - 3| = 2
 * , which is greater than maxDiff .
 *
 * - Thus, the final answer after processing all the queries is [true, false] .
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 4, nums = [2,5,6,8], maxDiff = 2, queries = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
 *
 * Output: [false,false,true,true]
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The resulting graph is:
 *
 * - Query [0,1] : There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 1 because |nums[0] - nums[1]| = |2 - 5| = 3
 * , which is greater than maxDiff .
 *
 * - Query [0,2] : There is no edge between Node 0 and Node 2 because |nums[0] - nums[2]| = |2 - 6| = 4
 * , which is greater than maxDiff .
 *
 * - Query [1,3] : There is a path between Node 1 and Node 3 through Node 2 since |nums[1] - nums[2]| =
 * |5 - 6| = 1 and |nums[2] - nums[3]| = |6 - 8| = 2 , both of which are within maxDiff .
 *
 * - Query [2,3] : There is an edge between Node 2 and Node 3 because |nums[2] - nums[3]| = |6 - 8| = 2
 * , which is equal to maxDiff .
 *
 * - Thus, the final answer after processing all the queries is [false, false, true, true] .
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * - 1 <= n == nums.length <= 10 5
 *
 * - 0 <= nums[i] <= 10 5
 *
 * - nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * - 0 <= maxDiff <= 10 5
 *
 * - 1 <= queries.length <= 10 5
 *
 * - queries[i] == [u i , v i ]
 *
 * - 0 <= u i , v i < n
